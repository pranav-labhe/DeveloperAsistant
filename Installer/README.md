   - The installer will automatically run this file during installation.

4. **Model Pull Script**

5. **Edit Product.wxs**
   - Update `Product.wxs` to include your app files and the Ollama installer as components.
   - Add a custom action to run the PowerShell script after installation.
   - See comments in `Product.wxs` for where to add these items.

6. **Build the Installer**
